226	76335	Weirdomusic is the nom-de-plume of 35 year old Marco Kalnenek from Heerlen, the Netherlands. The name was first used for his 1992 cassette release Someweirdomusic and is now the name of Marco's website Weirdomusic.com and all related musical activities.\n\nMarco started playing the piano at age 9. His first band Foolish Behaviour was formed around 1982, when he started jamming and recording tapes with his pal "Deurie" (Marco Dörenberg) and assorted other friends. Hundreds of hours of music and other noises were recorded in the 12 years that followed. A few cassettes and cd-r's were privately released and a couple of tracks turned up on compilations made by other people.\n\nIn 1994 Marco's interest in writing and recording music started to fade, mainly due to his bad experiences at the Conservatory of Music in Maastricht, where he studied jazz piano for 6 years between 1987 and 1993. Most of Weirdomusic's home recordings from 1982-1994 still survive in his cassette archive and will hopefully be transferred to cd-r in the not too distant future.\n\nIn 2001 two older recordings were remixed by Dutch musician Ton Rückert and Japanese dj Hideo Nakai for an as yet unreleased cd-compilation of Weirdomusic's work. Meanwhile Marco has been experimenting with pc based composing and recording. His first new recording in nearly 10 years was released on a new Comfort Stand release in april 2004. In winter 2004 Weirdomusic's netlabel WM Recordings will go online!	Added biography	2004-11-21 15:29:05.584538+00

910	51298	Official site: http://www.sonicyouth.com\n\nSonic Youth are Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley.\n\nSonic Youth are a five-piece band from New York. Emerging from the no-wave movement, their experimental noise distinguished them from other underground bands of the 1980s. Their signing to DGC in 1990 was unusual in the creative freedom given in the contract, and proved that it was possible to remain true to an independent ethic while on a major label.		2004-12-20 10:54:05.728606+00

They broke up after the second album and never reunited.

They formed in 2000 and have released two demos: "Atrophy" and "Dedales". Their work is distinctly more death metal then the first Atrophy. They are still working together at this time.

3268	94947	As with its namesake blossom's first appearance, peering from beneath the permafrost of Norway's winter, each successive Green Carnation album is a welcome sight in the dreary sameness of today's metal scene.\n\nBegun in 1990, it took the Kristiansand based death metallers a year before issuing the Hallucinations Of Despair demo. When guitarist Tchort ( Terje Vik Schei ) was offered a position within the ranks of the world renowned EMPEROR (as bassist, no less!), it seemed Green Carnation had suffered a premature death.\n\nFrom '92 to '98, Tchort busied himself with various bands, all amongst the hierarchy of black metal. In addition to Emperor, he contributed to the likes of Satyricon, Einherjer and Carpathian Forest (a post he's retained, to the current day). Meanwhile, the others formed In The Woods, ultimately recording three full albums and a variety of shorter pieces. In '98, the guitarist re-discovered his love of Green Carnation and reunited with original members Chris Botteri (guitar) and his brother, Christopher Botteri (bass). With the help of several guest vocalists, they recorded the Journey To The End Of Night debut. A concept album, sub-divided into 20-minute sections, it was inspired by the loss of Tchort's daughter. “We decided to get together again,” says the guitarist, “because we never really accomplished what we'd (originally) set out to do. After about half a year rehearsing, we recorded our first album, but the rest of the guys decided they wanted to continue making music individually, so I had to find a completely new line-up for the second record. In 2000, a decade after their inception, Green Carnation's first record was finally issued, by the German label, Prophecy Productions.\n\nWhile the album met with rave reviews throughout Europe, Green Carnation suffered the aforementioned line-up changes, as the Botteris departed. Original drummer Anders Kobro (a veteran of the In The Woods days, as well as playing alongside Tchort in the more brutal Carpathian Forest) returned, joining Tchort and newly recruited singer, Kjetil Nordus, whom later also joins fellow Norwegians, Trail Of Tears.\n\nThe new, six piece format, set about recording one of the most ambitious (and critically praised) projects of all time, Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness, this time inspired by the birth of Tchort's son. The hour-long platter is comprised solely of the title track. “You didn't see that one on Kaaza,” laughs its creator. A massive undertaking, recorded on 150 tracks, employs thirty musicians (including a children's choir), and more than 600 distinct samples, many reviewers were at a loss to pin down precisely what they heard, but there was no denying the brilliance within the sounds, declaring Green Carnation amongst the most innovative acts in metal's history.\n\nSurprisingly strong sales (given the unique nature of a one-song album), coupled with all the great reviews: twice being selected Album Of The Month, including within the vaunted pages of Metal Hammer (Germany), helped garner a 2002 slot on the prestigious Wacken Open Air festival, where Green Carnation re-created Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness, in its entirety, in front of 8000 fans. Not bad the first show outside your hometown!\n\nJust a few months later, buoyed by the successful live introduction, work began on a follow-up. Pre-production for Blessing In Disguise was held in October ‘02. During it's creation, longstanding bassist Stein Roger Sordal played an integral role, helping flesh out the lush sound. The actual recording took place from Jan-Feb. 2003, after Green Carnation had signed with French label, Season Of Mist.\n\nReleased on June 16 th of the same year, the Norwegians returned to the top of the global metal charts, awarded Album Of The Month honors six times, internationally recognized giants Terrorizer, Metal Hammer, and Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles, amongst them. The band even made a (long overdue) return to the live stage, showcasing Blessing In Disguise at a trio of summer festivals in their homeland: Quartz, Hole in the Sky and Elements of Metal, again receiving superlative reviews.\n\nThat fall, the band played throughout Europe, headlining, just their first time on tour! Michael S Krumins replaced Bjørn Harstad on guitar for the tour and successive live appearances. The demand for gigs created turmoil for some of the members and prior to heading to Poland, for the recording of a live DVD, Bernt A Moen (keyboards) left the band due to a busy personal schedule. While Øystein Tønnessen participated in the Alive And Well…In Krakow DVD, Kenneth Silden has since been tapped as permanent.\n\nFollowing the recording of The Quiet Offspring, from Aug – Sept. of 2004, original drummer Anders Kobro was replaced by Tommy Jackson, due to musical differences. The Quiet Offspring is scheduled to be released in February 2005 release through Season of Mist (world) and The End records (North America). The band is very anxious to see/hear the reactions, as they believe this is their most diverse, yet hardest album to date.\n\nVocalist Kjetil Nordhus says: "We have recorded 11 tracks in Sound Suite Studios with producer Terje Refsnes and we are very happy with the results and sound. It's heavier than anything we have done before and the production sounds awesome. Also once again we had the pleasure to work with the great artist Niklas Sundin, who provided us with the artwork."\n\nTaken from: http://www.green-carnation.tk/		2005-02-27 12:39:02.870713+00
1613	55131	Leroy Anderson (1908-1975) was one of the pre-eminent composers of "classical pops" music. Though best known for "Sleigh Ride" (originally a pure instrumental) and "Syncopated Clock" (used as theme music for the CBS "Late Show" and Jeopardy), he wrote many others just as deserving of attention which are still widely played in pops concerts.\n\nNote that although his first name is spelled normally, it seems to be universally pronounced le-ROY.

1907	90742	Pele were formed on Merseyside in 1990 by guitarist and frontman Ian Prowse and keyboard player Andrew Roberts. They were joined by Dally on drums, Jimmy McCallister on bass guitar and finally Nico on violin.\n\ndebut album\n\nAfter gigging around Liverpool and Chester the band were signed to brand new label M&G Records after the head of A&R (and old admirer of Ian's previous bands) heard a rough demo of Megalomania. Within weeks the band set about recording their debut LP, Fireworks, at Metropolis studios in London with producer Gary Langan.\n\nDebut single Raid the PalaceAs the album took shape the record company decided to rush out the first fruits of the sessions by releasing Raid The Palace as the first single. Everybody was stunned as BBC Radio 1 put the single on it's playlist for six weeks, especially as the songs lyrics suggested people should scratch the cars of the rich and then shoot them!\n\na hit single?\n\nMusically Pele had set out their stall: unbelievably melodic pop music led by a fiddle or piano riff, married to a set of words that were never throwaway. Whilst everybody warmed to this brand new band the record company were taken by surprise and their were no records in the shops resulting in no hit single and the first suspicions in the Pele camp that this new record company might not be up to the task.\n\nIn the week after release Pele hit the road with a gig at Kingston University, they basically didn't stop until 1995 with a gig at Treforrest (University of Wales). In between, the band played hundreds of gigs all over Europe and any Pele fan will tell you that it was on the stage that the band truly shone.\n\nnumber one\n\nIn February 1992 second single Megalomania was released. Again BBC Radio 1 playlisted the single and the band nearly died of surprise when the song went to number one in South Africa.\n\nFireworks, the Gary Langan-produced debut album The following month Fireworks the album was released to excellent local and national reviews. The album was a riot of infectious Celtic tinged, extremely lively pop. Dexy's were mentioned, the Waterboys were mentioned but most of all the live shows were not just being mentioned but raved about.\n\nThe summer saw the release of Fair Blows the Wind for France as the third single - although in truth the album was made up of twelve potential singles - and it was the bands biggest hit yet.\n\non tour\n\nHuge tours with Del Amitri and The Pogues followed and the year was rounded off with Fireworks Celtic Rumour EP, including live favourite Moondance, and their biggest headline tour yet.\n\nLead single from The Sport of Kings, Fat Black Heart The band then went straight into Rockfield studios in Wales to record the follow up album with producer Jon Kelly, picked because he had worked on Kate Bush's first album. Fat Black Heart was the band's first single off the new album and was also the bands first ballad.\n\nAfter the album was finished Jim mysteriously disappeared and only surfaced in June of 1998 year in exactly the same clothes! He was replaced on the bass guitar by the gorgeous Wayne Morgan. The day after Wayne joined the band Pele did a festival in Estonia shouting out the chords as they went along, then returned for their best ever show at The Phoenix Festival in England sending 4,000 Pele fans mad.\n\nsecond long player\n\nDon't Worship Me was Pele's sixth single - (a hit in Holland and Germany) and was followed in early December by The Sport Of Kings album. This second album was a reaction to criticism that the first album was relentless in it's upbeat vibe. It included a few more ballads used huge string riffs and was better produced than the first LP.\n\nSecond long player, The Sport of Kings Despite many great songs, the album didn't capture the essence of the band the way Fireworks did. The band themselves felt some of the songs were easily the best work they had done yet, but the so far excellent relationship between the label and the band was about to take a massive downturn.\n\n"guitar music is dead"\n\nIn spite of the fact that the band had not had a major hit M&G decided to 'pick up the option' and make a third Pele album. At this very time Steve Kutner - the A&R man who had signed and championed the band - decided to leave the company, his replacement Jack Stevens came from a dance music background and on the very dawn of Britpop told the band that reckin' live guitar bands were over and done with.\n\nA cumbersome attempt to split the band and sign Ian as a solo star was comprehensively rejected. Legally the record company had to make an album the new A&R man didn't want to make, a stand off ensued that rapidly diminished into a fierce and futile legal battle.\n\nstaying alive?\n\nLive album A-Live A-Live-O Against their own legal advice the band agreed to let the label release a live mini-album, A-Live A-Live-O in the hope the company might see things from the band's perspective. With nil promotion and selling to mailing list fans only, the live album was perceived as a stop-gap to the already written and demoed third LP.\n\nBut alas M&G Records redoubled their legal efforts and managed to drop the band on a technicality, and after a truly bitter fight, M&G were free of their financial obligations, leaving the band deep in debt.\n\nInjunctions meant the band didn't own anything not the songs or the name, so a period of depression ensued, only lifted with the news this year that M&G Records had closed down and the band could do what they liked with the name and the songs. All of a sudden (arguably) Britain's most exciting live band were free to record and play live again.\n\nfreedom\n\nAll the members of Pele have infact played music locally under assumed names in the last few years but now is the time for a new Pele chapter to begin. How exciting is that?! From Loughborough to Portsmouth from Glasgow to Canterbury, this band is not dead yet...\n\nThis Time Next Year, the third 'lost' Pele albumDecember 2001 saw the release of the third Pele album This Time Next Year, a collection of recorded songs and demos from 1994/5 that gives an indication of the direction Pele were going in. This album is available to but now from the Pele shop.\n\nthe next chapter\n\nLead singer/songwriter Ian has now formed a new band Amsterdam, who are signed to Superior Quality records and are set to release their official debut album in 2005.

If anyone knows a good site with composer info for Disney scores/soundtracks, please add it in this annotation. Then we can begin moving the albums/tracks to their composers.\n\nTake for example the following album: http://www.musicbrainz.org/album/482a4236-786b-4b64-b3a2-74d21b9b4172.html. Which information do we want to keep and how should we enter it? I now see a "compilation title", the "Disney company name", "movie titles", "track titles" & "year info an a track-by-track basis". What's missing is "composer name" and possibly/probably "performer name"\n\n-\n\nIf you wanted to read more you're probably eager to start cleaning up this artist. Then just look at this album, http://www.musicbrainz.org/showalbum.html?albumid=110090, to become desillusioned ;) Don't let it get you down though, I think it can be merged; but there's bound to more of these...	the link sould work now...	2005-02-04 00:19:13.482305+00

87934	270520	\r\n----\r\nArtist Information\r\nInstrumentation\r\nPaul Allgood, Jeff Hathaway,and J.J.Kidder\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nLet’s be honest. Most of today’s modern dance tracks are beat heavy and lyrically light.While there are some people who desire nothing more from  their music than ecstacy dropping and nipple stroking,  there are also people that yearn to find something deeper in the music besides a throbbing bass line. The wait just may be over. North Carolina-Virginia  based electropop outfit Wedlock, featuring Paul Allgood, Jeff Hathaway,and J.J.Kidder, can be described as infectious modern groove meets the pop sensibilities of legendary old schoolers like Pet Shop Boys, Kraftwerk, Soft Cell and Erasure.\r\nThe most striking element of Wedlock  is their attempt at  lyrical depth in  their  songs. Where most artists in his genre are content saying just  anything over their music to accompany the groove, Wedlock  reaches into the depths of its  heart and soul- albeit an electronic one, to deliver a message. It is a message of self definition, self exploration and an essential celebration of musical freedoms."Cuts Both Ways":THE MAXI-SINGLE, is the second release from Wedlock on Kounterfeit Records.Wedlock came about through a songwriting meeting and subsequent songwriting collaboration  between founding members Paul Allgood and Jeff Hathway.\r\n   Allgood, who is also a novelist, "An Inextricable Tale,"-2006, first tried his hand at being a solo artist, recording demos with the likes of Atlanta-based producer Bill Hume and Funkadelics' session guitarist Bill Mims, a South Carolina native.Allgood even pursued his dream across the ocean,briefly attending a Polytechnic in south England before returning to the states,but still no record deal was in sight.\r\n    Hathaway, who is also a commisioned artist, had been playing keyboards even as a child and to earn extra money would perform demonstration pieces on the store's equipment at the local malls.He had a brief stint in college with a couple of short-lived Raggae bands, but found his niche in studiowork.He produced soundtrack pieces  for networks like CNN and the The Learning Channel before striking out to do his own unique brand of German-influenced popsynth.\r\n        Shortly after the release of "Matrimony"in August of 2006, Wedlock began seeking remixers for the "Cuts Both Ways" single as well as players to  perform live in support of "Matrimony."After being rejected by various remixers like EDM, and several other local musicians, Anode Glow keyboardist J.J.Kidder, who hails from Minneapolis, answered an online ad.After Kidder heard the material from "Matrimony" he was "intrigued" by the project, and offered to do a remix of "Cuts Both Ways." From that point on, Kidder and Allgood got on especially well and Kidder eventually joined the group.\r\n        Wedlock will release "Audioseptic" on Kounterfeit Records in late May and are preparing to do live shows in support as a four-piece full on electronic band. The music just grabs you and the words, while delivered smoothly, reel you in like a largemouth bass caught in a river of dreams and curious wonder.  Only time and ultimately record sales will determine the fate of Wedlock’s musical future.  But one thing is for sure. Wedlock is hell bent on making a musical impact  and so far  we have the benefit of listening and watching the whole thing transpire.\r\n\r\n\r\nWebsite\r\nhttp://www.wedlockmusic.com\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\n"Matrimony," the EP 2006,"Cuts Both Ways"(MAXI-SINGLE-3/2007) "Audioseptic,(MAY)"2007.

3452	81629	The Saints are an influential Australian rock and roll band, formed in Brisbane in 1972. The original members were schoolmates Chris Bailey ( a singer-songwriter, later a guitarist); Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter) and; Ivor Hay (drummer). The Saints, who have never officially broken up, continue to inspire numerous other rock acts. Bailey is the only member who has lasted the distance, although the original line-up is regarded by many fans and critics as the most talented and influential.\n\nTheir musical inspiration came from sources as diverse as 1950s rock 'n' roll and 1960s Detroit punk band The Stooges. The Saints pre-empted the fast tempos and buzzing guitars of more widely-known punk acts like The Ramones and the Sex Pistols.\n\nWikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saints		2005-03-03 13:36:15.456346+00
