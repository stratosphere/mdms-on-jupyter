Some examples where this might be necessary:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Accurately credit an artist, for example if Artist A wrote the lyrics for part I and artist B wrote the lyrics for part II, even though there are no recordings of part I or part II by themselves'.</li>\r\n<li>Provide a complete list of parts, for example if parts I and IV have recordings, but parts II and III do not.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Recordings which comprise multiple parts should be linked to all of their component works.  Do not create additional works for every combination of parts. For example, if an artist records parts I and II of a work on one track and parts III and IV on another, do not create a work for parts I and II combined; just link the recording to the works for part I and part II.</p>	0
